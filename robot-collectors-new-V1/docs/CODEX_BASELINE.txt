## EDITING RULES (ENFORCED)
- One file per prompt; overwrite exact content.
- After every write, run a **VERIFY** block that prints the absolute path, size, SHA-256, and the first 80 lines of the file.
- Never `resume` old Codex sessions; start a new session for each patch.

## ROJO MAP (MUST MATCH)
ServerScriptService → { Server, Modules, World }  
ReplicatedStorage → { Shared }  
StarterPlayerScripts → { client }

## RUNTIME PROOFS (EXPECT TO SEE)
- [Spawn] ensured baseplate & spawn @ <timestamp>
- [Garage] frontZ: back/left/right/roof < planeZ (all front faces behind door plane)
- [Garage] Slats built: N slatH = DOOR_H / N
